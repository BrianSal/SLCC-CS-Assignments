This repository contains some of my coursework while I was a student at Salt Lake Community College.

I've also added some of my worked textbook solutions; from [Java for Everyone - Horstmann](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP003297.html).  I highly recommend this book for anyone just starting programming or those who'd like a quick review.
